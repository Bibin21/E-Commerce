# E-Commerce
 
Html,CSS, Javascript Ecommerce Website . It was my First project so code quality is low :). 

To run it in localhost install any localhost server like xaamp or waamp.

copy the files to htdocs folder incase of xaamp 

go to phpmyadmin and import the database from the file and you are good to go.
